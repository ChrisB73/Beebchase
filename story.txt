THE STORY SO FAR... It is 2501, 100 years after the Great War. The North American continent is ruled by mighty warlords in constant conflict over forest territory.
You are one of the elite mercenaries, Riders of the Big Bikes. It's a quick way to get rich - and a quicker way to die.
You patrol your forest day and night, chasing enemy Riders and destroying them with your guided photon bolts for $1000 a time. You may find helicopters and tanks too - your masters reward you particularly well if you destroy these.
You can only fire at the other Riders when at top speed and cannot hit them unless you are close enough - your range indicator will flash when you are in range and your purse increases as long as you are in such hot pursuit.
Clear all six sectors to attempt them again at super speed!
