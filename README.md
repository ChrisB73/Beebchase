Build.sh1 uses the [BeebAsm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm) assembler and the [lzsa](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) compressor which is also used in the code.\

The resources folder contains the beebspriter sprite source files\

Graphics based on those in this [disassembly](https://github.com/Ritchie333/deathchase)\
